This Python package implements a collection of useful methods to Sky-format data.
Sky format is defined in the femtosecond absorption measurement program, fs_kHz.exe, made by M. Yoshizawa in Tohoku university.
I created this package (Python2 version) when I was in the lab during my grad school period.

Python3 version updated in 2020/08/17
